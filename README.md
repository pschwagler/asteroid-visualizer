# Near Miss Asteroid Visualizer

This was a one-day creation to create a vizualizer for the asteroids that whizz by Earth on a selected day based on data from the NASA NEO earth close approaches API https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/

For scale: 3px === 1,000,000km
(Earth is ~1,046 times actual size, asteroids are anywhere from 1 - 300 million times actual size)

More to come (scaling size, velocity, displaying info, etc.)
